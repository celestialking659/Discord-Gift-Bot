# Discord-Gift-Bot
Education purposes only

Alright this should be easy to understand, clone the repo, run the following

npm install discord.js

node gift

That's it! add the bot to your discord, the command is 'gift' it will start to basically bruteforce discord gift links until the bot is stopped.
